    <ul>
        <li>Java is a high-level, general-purpose, memory-safe, object-oriented programming language.</li>
         <li>It is intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning 
            that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.</li>
        <li>Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) 
            regardless of the underlying computer architecture. </li>
        <li>The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. </li>
        <li>The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) 
            that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.</li>

    </ul>
